## Description

The Weather Web App is a web application that allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests to a weather API. The app displays weather data in a user-friendly format and handles error cases gracefully.

## Features

- **Homepage:** A simple user interface with a search input field and a "Get Weather" button.
- **Weather Display:** Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles cases where the location is not found or there's an issue with the API request.
- **Unit Selection:** Allows users to switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit).
- **Geolocation (Optional):** Offers the option to use the user's geolocation to fetch the weather for their current location.
- **Styling:** A visually appealing design with attention to layout, color scheme, and readability.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

1. Visit the [Weather Web App](https://example.com/weather-app).
2. Enter a location (e.g., city or ZIP code) in the search input field.
3. Click the "Get Weather" button to fetch weather data.
4. View the current weather conditions displayed on the page.
5. Optionally, use the toggle or dropdown to switch between temperature units.

## Error Handling

- If the entered location is not found, you'll see an error message indicating that the location was not found. Please check the spelling and try again.
- If there is an issue with the API request, you'll see an error message indicating that weather data couldn't be fetched. Please try again later.
